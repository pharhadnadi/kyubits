# Amazon has a warehouse where they are trying to optimize employee scheduling.
#     Each work shift has a duration in hours and a queue of tasks with an estimated completion time
# and a minimum skill level.
#
#     Given a list of employees with their skill level and a work shift, code an algorithm that
# returns the employees that should come in
# for work.The solution should minimize the difference
#   between task minimum skill level and the employeeâ€™s skill level.
#
#       Example :
#
#       The morning shift is 4 hours and the tasks are:
#                                                      1.Packing boxes (skill level: 1, estimated duration: 3 hours),
#       2.Loading shelves (skill level: 3, estimated duration: 3 hours)
#   3.Taking out garbage (skill level: 1, estimated duration: 2 hours)
#
#   The available employees are:
#                               1.Jake, skill level 2
#   2.Melissa, skill level 3
#   3.Juanita, skill level 1
#
#   Result : [Melissa, Juanita]
#
#   Explanation : Loading shelves requires a skill level 3, so Melissa must be assigned that task.
#       That task takes 3 hours, so she has 1 more hour during her shift to complete tasks.
#       Packing boxes is a skill level 1, so Juanita is assigned the task.This task takes 3 hours so she has
#   1 more hour to complete tasks.The remaining task is taking out the garbage which takes 2 hours.
#       Both Melissa and Juanita have 1 hour remaining, so they each spend 1 hour taking out garbage
#   until the task is complete.
